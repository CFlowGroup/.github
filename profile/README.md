## WELCOME TO THE RODRIGUEZ FLOW RESEARCH ORGANIZATION!

* We are the [Rodriguez Flow Research](https://sites.brown.edu/rodriguez/) group @ Brown University
* [Mauro Rodriguez Jr.](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mrodri97) is the PI of the group
* We solve flow problems involving gases, liquids, and solids using physics, numerical methods, and computers
* Public repositories contain open-source (e.g., MFC) and education (e.g., exact Riemann solver) softwares
* Users of the public repositories should be note the softwares' capabilities and limitations prior to use
* Education software should be for one's own scholarly education and not for class work
