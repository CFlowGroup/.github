## Welcome to the Computational Flow Group @ Brown University Github Organization!

* We are the [Computational Flow Group](https://www.computational-flow.group/) @ [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/)
* The PI of the group is [Mauro Rodriguez Jr.](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/mrodri97) 
* We are members of the [Fluid and Thermal Science Group](https://fluids.brown.edu/)
* We solve flow problems involving gases, liquids, and solids using physics, numerical methods, and computers
* Public repositories contain open-source (e.g., MFC) and education (e.g., exact Riemann solver) softwares
* Users of the public repositories should carefully read the softwares' capabilities and limitations prior to use
* Education software should be for one's own education and not for class work
* We are interested in collaborations! Feel free to reach out to the PI @ mauro_rodriguez@brown.edu
